you are using codeblocks which makes it not work, dont use codeblocks


I apologize for the confusion. You're right, and I understand now that you want a plain text version without code blocks. Here's the updated README content without any code blocks or special formatting:

Codebase Context Generator
This project includes a powerful script for generating a concise overview of your codebase. This tool is particularly useful for providing context to AI assistants during development discussions, enabling more accurate and context-aware responses.

Features
Recursively scans your source directory
Filters out irrelevant files and directories
Removes comments from code files
Compresses whitespace to reduce file size
Truncates long content for conciseness
Summarizes certain file types (e.g., CSS and SVG)
Combines all processed file contents into a single JSON file
Why It's Useful
Creates a compact representation of the entire codebase
Removes unnecessary elements, focusing on core code
Provides a structured overview for quick understanding of project structure
Handles large codebases efficiently
Ignores non-essential files and directories to reduce noise
Installation
Clone this repository
Navigate to the project directory
Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.
Usage
Open the generate_codebase_context.js file in the scripts directory.
Modify the outputFile and srcDirectory variables to match your project structure:
const outputFile = '/path/to/output/codebase_context.json';
const srcDirectory = '/path/to/your/src/directory';

Customize the ignoreDirs, ignoreFiles, and ignoreExtensions arrays if needed.
Run the script using Node.js:
node scripts/generate_codebase_context.js

The script will generate a JSON file at the specified outputFile location.
Use this JSON file to provide context to AI assistants when discussing your codebase.
Script Details
The script performs the following key actions:

File Filtering: Ignores specified directories, files, and file extensions.
Comment Removal: Strips both single-line and multi-line comments from code files.
Whitespace Compression: Reduces excessive whitespace to minimize file size.
Content Truncation: Shortens long strings and arrays for brevity.
File Summarization: Provides concise summaries for specific file types.
JSON Compilation: Assembles all processed file contents into a structured JSON object.
Customization
You can customize the script behavior by modifying the following variables:

ignoreDirs: Array of directory names to ignore
ignoreFiles: Array of file names or patterns to ignore
ignoreExtensions: Array of file extensions to ignore
fileExtensions: Array of file extensions to process (in the processFiles function call)
Contributing
Contributions to improve the script or expand its functionality are welcome.
